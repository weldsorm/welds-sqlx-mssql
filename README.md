# sqlx-mssql

This is a fork of the mssql driver from sqlx. 
It is updated to support sqlx 0.7. 

This crate is meant as a stopgap until the official mssql-pro driver is available.

The plan is to support mssql with this driver until the official one from sqlx is available.
At That point, This crate will be deprecated.
